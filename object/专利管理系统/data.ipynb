system for the administration of insurance companies is disclosed which includes a personal computer, a network and one or more file servers. The system further includes software for performing a plurality of functions which are interconnected and automatic. Manually entered data is verified, integrated into the database and the appropriate functions performed. A built-in audit system allows all transactions to be retrieved and all communications to be documented. A system allows for predefining via an activity scheduler first types of entered data that are processed by an activity processor in real time and second types of entered data that are queued for processing at another time.\n",

activity processor, and other computer comprises an activity scheduler. A file server is operatively connected to the networked computers. A data receiving and verifying unit receives and verifies data from any of the networked computers, against a manual entry unit and predetermined standard.\n",

A portable position acquisition apparatus, comprising:  a battery for providing power to said position acquisition apparatus;  a solar panel operatively connected to said battery to provide electrical change to said battery;  a position detection unit that detects position information pertaining to said position acquisition apparatus;  a memory that stores the position information;  a communication interface that enables said position acquisition apparatus to transmit the position information to a remote device; and  a controller operatively connected said position detection unit, said memory and said communication interface, said controller controls acquisition of the position information via said position detection unit in accordance with a first threshold as well as transmission of the position information to the remote device via said communication interface in accordance with a second threshold. \",\"LAU CHUNG | THOMAS C DOUGLASS\",\"LAU CHUNG | THOMAS C DOUGLASS\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"IPVENTURE INC\",\"LAU C | THOMAS C D\",\"LAUC|I|LAU C | THOM|I|THOMAS C D\",\"2\",\"Lau, Chung | Thomas, C.

A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein said position detection unit has at least a low-power state and a normal power state, and wherein said position detection unit remains in the low-power state while position information is not being acquired.   | 3. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein said position acquisition apparatus further comprises a battery for providing power to said position acquisition apparatus.   | 4. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 3, wherein said position detection unit has at least a low-power state and a normal power state, and wherein said position detection unit remains in the low power state while position information is not being acquired, whereby power of the battery is conserved when said position detection unit is in the low-power state.   | 5. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 1, wherein said position acquisition apparatus further comprises:  a communication interface that enables said position acquisition apparatus to transmit data to a remote device via a wireless channel.    | 6. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 5, wherein the data being transmitted includes at least the position information.   | 7. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 5, wherein said communication interface transmits the position information to the remote device only when the position information differs from prior position information by at least a second threshold amount.   | 8. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 7, wherein the second threshold amount is user configurable or dynamic based on a condition of said position acquisition apparatus.   | 9. A portable position acquisition apparatus as recited in claim 5,  wherein said communication interface has at least a normal power state and a low-power state, and   wherein, when the position information differs from prior position information by at least a second threshold amount, said communication interface transitions to the normal power state and then transmits the position information to the remote device.    | 10.
